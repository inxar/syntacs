SYNTACS TRANSLATION TOOLKIT
================================================================

This message is to announce the Syntacs Translation Toolkit (STT), yet
another member of the Yet Another family of compiler generator tools.
The STT was borne out of a general desire to understand lexical and
syntactic analysis; perhaps it may even be of utility to others...  It
does:

  - Generation of regular-expression-based lexers in Java
  - Generation of shift-reduce parsers (SLR1, LALR1, LR1) in Java

The STT has some sporty features:

  - Supports 16-bit (Unicode) lexing
  - Unique support of lexical states (states are managed with a stack)
  - SLR1/LALR1/LR1 DPA construction algorithms
  - Deremer-Penello LALR1 construction algorithm
  - Customizable parser error recovery/repair
  - Grammars can be written in "syntacs format" (.stt) or XML
  - Postscript/PNG visualization of finite automata using "Graphviz"
  - Postscript/PNG visualization of pushdown automata using "Graphviz"
  - Pretty printing of parse trees
  - Relatively modular design 
  - Decent documentation
  - GPL License

The STT is too early to recommend for production work but it's quite
cool, has a nice modular design, and has good support visualization of
internal structures; it's immediately useful for educational use and
for algorithm experimentation.

You are respectfully encouraged to download it and give it a go.  Even
better, get involved to help make it a better tool!
