<P>

This is the Syntacs Translation Toolkit (STT), yet another member of
the Yet Another family of compiler generator tools.  The STT was borne
out of a general desire to understand lexical and syntactic analysis;
perhaps it may even be of utility to others...  It does:

<UL>

  <LI> Generation of regular-expression-based lexers in Java

  <LI> Generation of shift-reduce parsers (SLR1, LALR1, LR1) in Java

</UL>

The STT has some sporty features:

<UL>

  <LI> Supports 16-bit (Unicode) lexing
  <LI> Unique support of lexical states (states are managed with a stack)
  <LI> <strike>SLR1</strike>/LALR1/LR1 DPA construction algorithms
  <LI> Deremer-Penello LALR1 construction algorithm
  <LI> Customizable parser error recovery/repair
  <LI> Grammars can be written in "syntacs format" (.stt) or XML
  <LI> Postscript/PNG visualization of finite automata using "Graphviz"
  <LI> Postscript/PNG visualization of pushdown automata using "Graphviz"
  <LI> Pretty printing of parse trees
  <LI> Relatively modular design 
  <LI> Decent documentation
  <LI> GPL License

</UL>

One feature is that an STT grammar file does not contain semantic
actions (no code).  Rather, a separate component is implemented by the
grammar author which is responsible for responding to lexical and
syntactic events to do the actual abstract syntax tree construction.
Therefore, the STT has a minimalist philosophy of only trying to
automate that which is easily automatable.

<P>


The STT is too early to recommend for production work but it's quite
cool, has a nice modular design, and has good support visualization of
internal structures; it's immediately useful for educational use and
for algorithm experimentation.
