lib/README: Information about the included bytecode.

syntacs.jar
======================================================================
This is the jar created from the sourcecode distributed in the src.jar
file.

jenesis.jar
======================================================================
Jenesis is a sourcecode generation library; it comes as it's own
distribution. You can learn more about it and get the full thing from
[http://www.inxar.org/jenesis].  The version included is 0.2.3, unless
I have changed it and forgotten to update this section.

xerces.jar
======================================================================
This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
Foundation (http://www.apache.org/). [xerces.jar]

Syntacs requires the W3C DOM Interfaces, SAX Interfaces, and an XML
parser for full functionality.  The xerces-j parser is distributed
with Syntacs.

If you would like to substitute another parser you may do so.  The Sun
XML-TR2, Sun XML-Crimson, and Sun JAXP parsers should work without any
source code adjustments, just place it in the classpath in lieu of
xerces.  For use of other parsers, modify the
com.inxar.syntacs.util.DOM.getDocument method.
